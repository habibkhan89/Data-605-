# Problem 1

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('3-1.png')
```

## 1.1

```{r}
# Reading library

library(matrixcalc)

# Feed the data into R

A <- matrix(c(1,-1,0,5,2,0,1,4,3,1,-2,-2,4,3,1,-3), nrow=4, ncol=4)
A

# Calculating rank of matrix with R

matrix.rank(A)
```

## 1.2

Maximum rank for m x n  where m > n is n whereas minimum rank for m x n matrix where m > n and having the assumption of non-zero is 1. 

## 1.3

```{r}
B <- matrix(c(1,3,2,2,6,4,1,3,2), nrow=3, ncol=3)
B

#Rank for matrix B is:
matrix.rank(B)
```

# Problem 2
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('3-2.png')
```

```{r}
# Creating matrix with the given numbers 

A2 <- matrix(c(1,0,0,2,4,0,3,5,6),nrow=3, ncol=3)
A2

# Using eigen function, we will print eigen and vector
result <- eigen(A2)

# Now, we will print out eigen and vectors from the saved value 'result'
result$values
result$vectors
```
