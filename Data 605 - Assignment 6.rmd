# Problem 1 

A box contains 54 red marbles, 9 white marbles, and 75 blue marbles. If a marble is randomly selected from the box,
what is the probability that it is red or blue? Express your answer as a fraction or a decimal number rounded to four
decimal places.

```{r}
prob1 <- 129/138 * 100
prob1
```

# Problem 2

You are going to play mini golf. A ball machine that contains 19 green golf balls, 20 red golf balls, 24 blue golf balls, and 17 yellow golf balls, randomly gives you your ball. What is the probability that you end up with a red golf ball? Express your answer as a simplified fraction or a decimal rounded to four decimal places.

```{r}
prob2 <- 20/80 * 100
prob2

# Problem 3

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('6-3.png')

```{r}
prob3 <- ((228+79+252+97+72)+(1399-(215+252))-(728-252))/1399 * 100

# Problem 4

Determine if the following events are independent.
Going to the gym. Losing weight.

Answer: A) Dependent B) Independent


Going to gym is independent but losing weight is depending


# Problem 5

A veggie wrap at City Subs is composed of 3 different vegetables and 3 different condiments wrapped up in a tortilla. If
there are 8 vegetables, 7 condiments, and 3 types of tortilla available, how many different veggie wraps can be made?


```{r}
prob5 <- choose(8,3)*choose(7,3)*3
prob5
```

# Problem 6

Determine if the following events are independent.
Jeff runs out of gas on the way to work. Liz watches the evening news.

Answer: A) Dependent B) Independent

They are independent

# Problem 7 


The newly elected president needs to decide the remaining 8 spots available in the cabinet he/she is appointing. If there
are 14 eligible candidates for these positions (where rank matters), how many different ways can the members of the
cabinet be appointed?

prob7
```

# Problem 8

A bag contains 9 red, 4 orange, and 9 green jellybeans. What is the probability of reaching into the bag and randomly
withdrawing 4 jellybeans such that the number of red ones is 0, the number of orange ones is 1, and the number of green
ones is 3? Write your answer as a fraction or a decimal number rounded to four decimal places.


```{r}
gggo <- (9/22) * (8/21) * (7/20) * (4/19)
ggog <- (9/22) * (8/21) * (4/20) * (7/19)
gogg <- (9/22) * (4/21) * (8/20) * (7/19)
oggg <- (4/22) * (9/21) * (8/20) * (7/19)
prob8 <- gggo + ggog + gogg + oggg 
prob8 * 100

# Problem 10

67% of subscribers to a fitness magazine are over the age of 34.


33 percent of the subscribers to a fitness magazine are under the age of 34


# Problem 11

If you throw exactly three heads in four tosses of a coin you win $97. If not, you pay me $30.
Step 1. Find the expected value of the proposition. Round your answer to two decimal places.
Step 2. If you played this game 559 times how much would you expect to win or lose? (Losses must be entered as
negative.)

```{r}
A <- 0.5^4 * choose(4,3)

# Step 1

B <- A * 97 - (1-A) *30
B

# Step 2

B * 559
```


# Problem 12

12. Flip a coin 9 times. If you get 4 tails or less, I will pay you $23. Otherwise you pay me $26.
Step 1. Find the expected value of the proposition. Round your answer to two decimal places.
Step 2. If you played this game 994 times how much would you expect to win or lose? (Losses must be entered as
negative.)

```{r}
A <- sum(dbinom(4:0,9,0.5))

# Step 1

B <- A * 23 - (1-A)*26
B

# Step 2

B * 994
```


# Problem 13

The sensitivity and specificity of the polygraph has been a subject of study and debate for years. A 2001 study of the
use of polygraph for screening purposes suggested that the probability of detecting a liar was .59 (sensitivity) and that
the probability of detecting a "truth teller" was .90 (specificity). We estimate that about 20% of individuals selected for the screening polygraph will lie.

a. What is the probability that an individual is actually a liar given that the polygraph detected him/her as such? (Show
me the table or the formulaic solution or both.)

b. What is the probability that an individual is actually a truth-teller given that the polygraph detected him/her as
such? (Show me the table or the formulaic solution or both.)

c. What is the probability that a randomly selected individual is either a liar or was identified as a liar by the
polygraph? Be sure to write the probability statement.


```{r}
# Let's add the values first

liar <- 0.2
truth <- 0.80
liar_sens <- 0.59
truth_sens <- 0.90

pos_det_liar <- liar * liar_sens
false_det_liar <- truth * (1-truth_sens)

#(a)
actualliar <- pos_det_liar/(pos_det_liar + false_det_liar)
actualliar

# (B)

pos_det_truth <- truth * truth_sens
false_det_truth <- liar * (1-liar_sens)

actuallytruth <- pos_det_truth/(pos_det_truth + false_det_truth)
actuallytruth


# (c)

liarsidentified <- liar + false_det_liar
liarsidentified
```


The probability that a randomly selected individual is liar is 0.28
