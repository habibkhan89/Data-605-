```{r}

```{r}
# Calculating N 

Q <- matrix(c(0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5), ncol=2, byrow= T)
I <- diag(2)
IQ <- I - Q
N <- solve(IQ)

print(N)
```

The expected number of nice days and snowy days before rain starts are 0.6667 and 2.667 respectively.

```{r}
# Calculating Nc 

c <- matrix(c(1, 1), ncol= 1, byrow=T)
Nc <- N %*% c
print(Nc)
```

Expected number of nice and snowy days until the next rainy day is 2.66 and 3.33 respectively

```{r}
# Calculation of N.R

R <- matrix(c(0.5, 0.25), ncol = 1, byrow= T)
N.R <- N %*% R
print(N.R)
```

There is 100 percent probability of reaching of both rainy and snowy day
