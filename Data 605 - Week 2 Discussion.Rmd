# Create matrix for W and B
W = matrix(c(1,2,-1,1,1,0,3,1,2,1,1,2), 4,3) 
B = matrix(c(1,1,0,1), 4,1)

# Merge both matrix into df

data <- cbind(W,B)

# Load the library

library(pracma)

# Calculate RREF using R's function

rref(data)
```

The above is in the subspace of W because of non-zero value
