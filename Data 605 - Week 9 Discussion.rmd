# Problem 10 from Page 339

## Find the probability that among 10,000 random digits the digit 3 appears not more than 931 times. 

```{r}
times <- 931
random <- 10000
prob <- 1/10
mu <- random*prob

a_sq <- (random*prob)*(1-prob)
a <- sqrt(a_sq)

answer <- (times-mu)/a
pnorm(answer)*100
```

Probability that among 10,000 random digits the digit 3 appears is 1.072411 %
